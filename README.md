# Codependency
Zachariah's Codependent quote brought to you in AO3 skin by @codependeancy.

This skin is a modified version of @achillesuwuâ€™s code on Tumblr, which I fell in love with at first sight because of its simple and warm contrast. The only things I modified are minor changes in border colors, and inserting header and footer images, which should be adjustable according to your screen sizes (phone and laptop) by the end of this guide. 

**IMPORTANT:** As I have absolutely 0 background in coding, I can only be sure that only these header and footer images will work for this code due to potential sizing issues. If you would like to customize your own header and footer images, please be advised that results may be cropped and that you would have to modify the code yourself. 

The full guide is available on my ao3.
