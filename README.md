# Codependency
Zachariah's Codependent quote brought to you in AO3 skin by @codependeancy.

This skin is a modified version of @achillesuwuâ€™s code on Tumblr, which I fell in love with at first sight because of its simple and warm contrast. The only things I changed are the header and footer, which should be adjustable according to your screen sizes (phone and laptop) by the end of this guide. 

IMPORTANT: As I have absolutely 0 background in coding, I can only be sure that only these header and footer images will work for this code due to potential sizing issues. If you would like to customize your own header and footer images, please be advised that results may be cropped and that you would have to modify the code yourself. 

Process Overview: We are going to create a set of skins: BASE, LAPTOP, PHONE, and DEFAULT. Think of the whole process as building a house:

BASE is the foundation: it holds the structure, color palette, and main design of the entire layout.
LAPTOP is the furnished home: it adds full-size elements and visuals that look best on wide screens.
PHONE is the compact apartment: the same design, but rearranged and resized to fit comfortably in smaller spaces.
DEFAULT is the key that opens the door: it connects everything together so AO3 knows which layout to display depending on your device.
